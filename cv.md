Highest and Lowest.

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

`
function highAndLow(numbers){
    const sorted = numbers.split(' ').map(n => parseInt(n)).sort((a, b)=>a-b);
    return `${sorted[sorted.length - 1]} ${sorted[0]}`;
}
